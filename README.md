# EMTAS

EMTAS (pronounced em-TASS) is something like a [tool-assisted
speedrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun), but
for your Emacs startup time. It is a toolkit which allows you to
leverage many dozens of hours of other people's research and
development in order to make your Emacs in as few milliseconds as is
conceivable. If the motivation for doing this isn't already obvious to
you, then you're not in the target audience :)
